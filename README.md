# Score Keeper kata

I've practiced the [Score Keeper kata](http://kata-log.rocks/score-keeper-kata), in kotlin.

## Implementation notes

  1. Start with a baby-steps solution
  1. Implement the basic behaviour, until we need a scaffold
  1. Refactor to introduce a more general solution, using parallel change
  1. Keep adding features
  1. When feature complete, re-design the application so it uses another component. This makes it easier to test, as the tests themselves are not coupled to the implementation

## Boilerplate

A boilerplate for kotlin + gradle + mockito + junit 4 + arrow, shadowjar/uberjar. Customized to my taste.
